Plural sight:
What is node js?

Server side javscript, open source server side runtime environment Not a language.
cross platform.
Uses javascript as its language.

What is express?
Express is a web development framework, lightweigh unoopinionated and minimalist 
an npm package sitting inside node

Node is just a wrapper around javascript and allows us to executre commands, e.g. in a terminal run node and in the command liine use console.log to output a string back to the command line.

We can also simply create a javascript file and run it in a command prompt by typing node filename.js

teh whole application is a single file that gets executed, thisis the idea behind single page web apps that are popular for their power.

npm is the package management system for node.js, all pulled in using npm.
npm deals with versions for you 

can use npm init to configure a packjage.json file, used to keep track of dependencies installed in application.

we need express so use
npm install express --save
--save adds dependencies to package.json file

npm will install any same major version and deal with versioning for us
can use a ^ for major version, or ~for minor version. or just put specific version number in

Javascript, a callback is a function that app.listen will execute

we need a standard way to execute the application, use npm for this
add start to scripts in package.json 

running 'npm start' is standard to get code up and running 

app.get = home route, run on local host to view results

Use bootstrap or templates to improve UI. e.g. bootstrapzero

setup public directory as static directory that express server will serve up

app.use setsup what will be used by express first.
can make any files a static folder to load before routing

in order to use all the latestversions of bootstrap / jquery etc use bower = front end system.

Bower = package manager for the front end  (mathces with npm for backend)
bower has flat package hierarchy, does not install dependencies
have a bower.json to match package.json
 
npm istall bower -g
run 'bower' command to see if it's instaled.
start with bower init

needed git installed to run from windows command prompt

bower intsall --save bootstrap
also downloaded all dependencies for the package, jquery for bootstrap

all installed into bower-componenets automatically. we configure bower to install to public
create .bowerrc file, simply json but key needs to be in quotes! 

{
	"directory": "public/lib"
}

to separate out all packages coming form bower

bower install font-awesome --save

alter index.html to link to correct files now in public/lib

Using GULP to automate...

Gulp is a task manager for web projects 
installed with npm
easy to use
code based config
package based

using JSHint for code quality enforcement
detects errors, enforces coding conventions and is configurable & open source
Also JSCS for code styles
code style enforcement e.g. indentations

.jscsrc and .jshintrc are config files

use gulp to inject bower packages into html
use wiredep

use bower:js comment in html and gullp inject to inject js
use overrides for css

nodemon to monitor files and auto update server

jade is a templating enjine that runs through a compiler
jade removes tags
whitespace and tab based
jade operates as javascrit

in gulpfile change .src to *.jade instead of .html

handlebars is a minimalist templating engine to write html and plugin ars and functionality as needed.
