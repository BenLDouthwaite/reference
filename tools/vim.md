- Disclaimer: Many notes sourced from Practical Vim by Drew Neil

## TODO - learning

- Touch typing. need to practice. Reasonably good as it stands, but could be much better, with fewer typos

## Vim Tutor

- `vimtutor` is a built in command after installing vim

## Useful commands

- `::E` to enter Explore mode, and see file explorer
- `gg=G` to reformat the entire file
- `<c-r>=` to access expression register inputs
- In visual mode use `o` to toggle the free end
- Replacing instances, `f{char}` ro find a character, `s{chars}` to set replacement, `;` to find next instance, `.` to repeat
- Commenting a block of code. `<C-V>` and select block in visual block mode. `shift + I` to enter insert mode. Make the desired change, e.g. adding '//' at the start of the line. Change will be replicated
