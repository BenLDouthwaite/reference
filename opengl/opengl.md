# Open GL

Notes:

Need to install cmake to build.

need to install glfw , used as a library for low level stuff



command to build cmake: (from cmake folder)

`./bootstrap --gt-gui`

need to install `libx11-dev`

need to install `sudo apt-get install xorg-dev libglu1-mesa-dev`



**TODO** 

I need to read up on cmake.

need to study some basic c++, understand  better how all the drivers fit together



## Actual Code!
