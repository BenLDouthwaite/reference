# SRS - Spaced Repetition Software

A language learning CLI util to ask questions during downtime

## TODO 

* Ask multiple questions from hardcoded data
* Read questions from a file

- Choose which file to read from, 1 file per language
- Ability to add new questions and answers from command line
- Clear terminal after each question
- Flag an answer or questions as incorrect to be reviewed
- Have a default file to read
